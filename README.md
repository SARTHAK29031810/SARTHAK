OOP KEYWORDS -



**1) COMPUTATION -**


   Computation is the process of executing instructions in a computer program.
   Components-

   CPU - Central Processing Unit
   
   GPU-Graphics Processing Unit

   DPU-Data Processing Unit

   TPU- Tensor Processing Unit


   **.SOC(System On a Chip)-**


   A single integrated circuit that contains all the main components of a computer or electronic system. It integrated all the components on a single substrate(a thin film of silicon used to fabricate integrated circuits). Smaller size, lower power consumption, faster communication between components etc are some of its major advantages.


   **2)Storage -**

   i)Primary storage:

 a)It's volatile

 b)Provides faster access

 c)But smaller storage capacity


ii)Secondary Storage:

a)Non volatile

b)Slower access

c)Larger storage Capacity


**3)Operating System(OS) -** 


 Most common OS used are - 

 a)WINDOWS

 b)LINUX

 c) MACos

 It has mainly two major regions -

 a) User space :

 This is where applications and programs run.

 b)Kernel spave:

 It is a dedicated memory area where the core of the OS, the kernel, resides and executes. It's a protected environment where the kernel manages hardware resources, performs system-level tasks, and provides a stable foundation for running applications. 


 **4) CLOSED SOURCE and OPEN SOURCE -**

 i)OPEN SOURCED:

 a)Software whose source code is made publicly available so anyone can view, use, modify, and distribute it.

 b) It is usually released under licenses like GPL, MIT, Apache, BSD, etc.

 c)Some examples can be Linux, GIMP, LibreOffice etc.


 ii) ClOSED SOURCE:

 a) Software where the source code is not publicly available and only the developers or the company that owns it can access, modify, or distribute it.

 b) Some examples can be Microsoft Windows, macOS etc.


 **5)Front-end and Back-end  -**

i)Front-end :

a)Also reffered to as client side

b)It is the part of a website/app that the user sees and interacts with in their browser.

c)It's main job is  to make the site look good, be easy to use, and work smoothly on all devices.


ii)Back-end :

a)Also reffered to as server side.

b)It is the part of the system that runs on the server â€” processes requests and stores data.

c)It's main job is to process the user's requests and manage performance.
